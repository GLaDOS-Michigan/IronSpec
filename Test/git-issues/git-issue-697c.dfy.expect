git-issue-697c.dfy(18,15): Error: EvenCell is a subset type and its constraint is not compilable, hence it cannot yet be used as the type of a bound variable in set comprehension. The next error will explain why the constraint is not compilable.
git-issue-697c.dfy(9,26): Error: function calls are allowed only in specification contexts (consider declaring the function a 'function method')
git-issue-697c.dfy(19,35): Error: EvenCell is a subset type and its constraint is not compilable, hence it cannot yet be used as the type of a bound variable in map comprehension. The next error will explain why the constraint is not compilable.
