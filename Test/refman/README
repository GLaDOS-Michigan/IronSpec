These tests simply point to .dfy files that are part of the reference manual.
Any substantial block of dafny code in the reference manual is pulled into a
.dfy file that is both included in the RM and is included in tests here.
This permits checking that the actual dafny text in the RM parses correctly and
gives the errors that are described in the RM text.
