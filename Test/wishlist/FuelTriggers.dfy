// With the default version of opaque + fuel, the following fails to verify
// because the quantifier in the requires used a trigger that included
// StartFuel_P, while the assert used StartFuelAssert_P.  Since P is
// opaque, we can't tell that those fuels are the same, and hence the
// trigger never fires. A wish would be to fix this.
