title: Can datatypes extend traits?
---

## Question:

I heard a rumor of datatypes extending traits coming in the pipeline. How will that work? Will we be able to use `is` and `as` with such types?

## Answer:

Yes, datatypes extending traits are coming (but not immediately).
The traits would need to be declared when the datatype is declared; the trait cannot be added later on.
`is` and `as` are possible.
